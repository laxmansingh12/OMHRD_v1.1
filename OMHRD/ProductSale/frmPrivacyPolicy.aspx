                    <h4>Like most every web site, the OM HRD  Site records certain tracking information any time someone visits the site.</h4>
                    <h4>For every web page that is viewed, our web server records an IP address, the operating system, browser version and the name of the page that was viewed.</h4>
                    <h4>We use a third-party tracking service that uses tracking technologies to track non-personal information about visitors to our site.</h4>

                    <h4>Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.</h4>
                    <h4>In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</h4>
                    <h4>We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.</h4>
                    <h4>We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.</h4>
                    <h4>This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</h4>

                    <h4>OM HRD  is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We place a priority on protecting your Personally Identifiable Information and take commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect such information.</h4>
                    <h4>The OM HRD  Sites use secure sockets layer (SSL) to encrypt the transfer of sensitive information, such as your account password and billing information including credit card, from your web browser to our web server.</h4>
                    <h4>Only the last four (4) digits of your credit card number will be displayed in your account.</h4>

                    <h4>Emails you send to us may not be secure unless otherwise told that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For this reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as credit card numbers or account numbers to us through emails</h4>
                    <h4>The same SSL protocol also acts to authenticate the OM HRD  Sites and prevent unauthorized "hackers" from masquerading as any of our sites while you are logged in to your account. This is accomplished through a "digital certificate", which is an unforgettable electronic "identity card".</h4>
                    <h4>If another website attempts to falsely identify itself as a OM HRD  site, your web browser will display a warning indicating that there is a problem with the digital certificate for the OM HRD  Site. Do not log in to those sites if you see any such warning.</h4>
                    <h4>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.</h4>
                    <h4>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</h4>
                    <h4>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at <a href="http://www.omhrd.com/">privacy@OMHRD.com</a></h4>
